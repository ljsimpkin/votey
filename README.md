# votey
## A party game voting app

Built to help groups make decisions, this project taught me a lot about about web sockets with socket.io, how to break down projects with spikes, data structures, one directional data flow which enables testing, designing using figma, and how to deploy with heroku for the back end and github for the front end.

# Bugs

- [x] When creator clicks on their own idea to remove vote, it removes all the votes
- [ ] 2 people clicking next at the same time move twice. Will be solved with ready up or a one page app.
- [ ] Double votes when people refresh and rejoin room. Readying up and not allowing new joins after would solve this.
