# deploy
`git push heroku main:main`

# features

- [x] Deploy!! Github pages and Heroku perhaps?
- [ ] Combine drafting and voting onto one page
- [ ] Add url to room
- [ ] Add QR code to lobby

- [ ] Identify when your vote is cast
- [ ] Display people's names in the lobby
- [ ] Have admin privelages
- [ ] Only view next arrow if admin
- [ ] Ready up to move to the next round

# Bugs

- [ ] 2 people clicking next at the same time move twice. Will be solved with ready up or a one page app.
- [ ] Double votes when people refresh and rejoin room. Readying up and not allowing new joins after would solve this.
