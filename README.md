# votey
## A party game voting app

Built to help groups make decisions, this project taught me a lot about about web sockets with socket.io, how to break down projects with spikes and data structures, design using figma, and how to deploy with heroku for the back end and github for the front end.

# deploy
`./deploy`
`git push heroku main:main`
